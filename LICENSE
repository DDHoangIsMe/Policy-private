PRIVACY POLICY
Last updated November 07, 2025

1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
We collect personal information you provide, such as usernames when you interact with us or use our Services. If you make purchases, payment data may be collected and processed by Google Play in accordance with their Privacy Policy.
We may also collect device-related data (e.g., device ID, model, OS, IP address) to ensure app functionality, security, and analytics. We do not collect sensitive personal information.
If our app uses Google APIs, we comply with the Google API Services User Data Policy, including Limited Use requirements.

2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?
We use your data to operate and improve our Services, manage accounts, deliver features, ensure security, and meet legal requirements. Additional uses may apply with your consent.

3. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
We may share your data with trusted third-party service providers (e.g., cloud services, ad networks) who help us operate and improve the app. These parties are contractually required to protect your data and use it only as instructed.
We may also share your information in cases such as business transfers (e.g., mergers or acquisitions) or when using third-party offer walls that reward users for completing ads. In such cases, a unique ID may be shared to credit your account and prevent fraud.

4. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?
Our Services may include links or ads from third parties not affiliated with us. We are not responsible for their content, privacy practices, or how they handle your data. Any information you share with them is outside the scope of this Privacy Policy. Please review their policies before interacting.

5. DO WE OFFER ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-BASED PRODUCTS?
We may offer features powered by artificial intelligence (e.g., image generation) through third-party providers. Your input and related data may be shared with these providers to deliver the service, in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Do not use AI features in ways that violate their terms.

6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
We keep your personal information only as long as needed for the purposes described, or as required by law. When no longer needed, we delete or anonymize your data, or securely store it until deletion is possible.

7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?
We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data. However, no system is 100% secure, so any data transmission is at your own risk. Please use our Services in a secure environment.

8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?
You may review, update, or delete your account at any time by contacting us. If we rely on your consent to process data, you can withdraw it anytime. Account deletion may retain some data for legal or security reasons.
For questions, email us at ner.contactwork@gmail.com.

9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.

10. COMMUNITY LINKS
Our app includes a link to our official Discord community. Participation in the Discord server is voluntary and subject to Discord’s own Privacy Policy. We do not collect or store any personal information from users through this link.

11. HOW CAN YOU REVIEW, UPDATE, OR DELETE THE DATA WE COLLECT FROM YOU?
You may have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data, depending on your local laws. To make a request, please contact us at ner.contactwork@gmail.com.
